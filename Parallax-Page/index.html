        </h1>
        <p>
            The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
            northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
            nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the
            7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
            first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties
            built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the
            wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

        <p>
            Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and
            archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water
            conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the stone
            from which it is carved; it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in
            a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a
            basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running
            from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through a famously
            picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to
            the Khazneh.

        <p>
            The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy,
            just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is
            still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began
            under the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and
            heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. The three
            emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the
            amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists
            for its association with their family name (Flavius).

        </h1>
        <p>
            Chichén Itzá (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a
            large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
            archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá
            was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic
            (c. AD 600-900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early portion
            of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900-1200). The site exhibits a multitude of
            architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and
            Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was
            once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from
            central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these
            non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.

        <p>
            Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of
            southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred to as the "Lost
            City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in
            the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80
            kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through
            the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. In reference to
            the site's name, for most English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent.

            The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna
            in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor,
            Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb
            of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
            which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
            sides by a crenellated wall.

        <p>
            Christ The Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
            created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da
            Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor
            Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30
            metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres
            (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ The Redeemer
            differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ
            with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers
            originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms
            spread out wide.
