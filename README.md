# HTML-CSS-Practices

**These projects were suggested by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/) and made for practice after watching [BroCode's video on HTML and CSS](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=MQQ9QV7qBWbJt2Oj).**  
  
The intend was to learn HTML and CSS and get comfortable with it before i move on to learn Javascript and/or Typescript.
